# 4th SFML Game Jam

## Theme: From the end to the beginning

Not much to say yet; I'm still thinking about the theme, plus working on the engine and boilerplate, so I don't know if I'll even get to writing an actual game in time to submit it. :(

### Build Instructions

```bash
git clone https://github.com/criptych/sfmljam4.git sfmljam4
cd sfmljam4
git submodule init
git submodule update
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

If all goes well, you should have an executable file `untitled` (`untitled.exe` on Windows) and a folder `data`.  (If the folder is missing, copy it from the source directory.)
